# Broken Access Control Vulnerability Labs

This repository contains a set of labs designed to demonstrate and understand Broken Access Control vulnerabilities. These labs are educational and intended for learning purposes. Do not deploy or use these examples in a production environment.

## Broken Access Control Vulnerability

Broken Access Control is a security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows users to perform actions or access data they shouldn't have permission to. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or privilege escalation. Attackers may exploit these weaknesses to manipulate user accounts, access sensitive information, or perform unauthorized actions within the application.

For more information on Broken Access Control, refer to the [OWASP Broken Access Control Guide](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/).

These labs are created for educational purposes. Do not use them in a production environment. The vulnerabilities demonstrated in these labs should be understood and mitigated in real-world applications.

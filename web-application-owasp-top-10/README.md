# Web Application OWASP Top 10 Labs

Welcome to the Web Application OWASP Top 10 Labs repository! This project is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding and mitigating the OWASP Top 10 most critical web application security risks.

## OWASP Top 10 Overview

The [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/top10) is a regularly updated awareness document that highlights the most critical security risks to web applications. The list is curated by security experts from around the world and serves as a valuable resource for developers, security professionals, and anyone involved in web application development.

### The OWASP Top 10 for 2021:

1. **[A01 Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)**
2. **[A02 Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)**
3. **[A03 Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)**
4. **[A04 Insecure Design](https://owasp.org/Top10/A04_2021-Insecure_Design/)**
5. **[A05 Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)**
6. **[A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)**
7. **[A07 Identification and Authentication Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/)**
8. **[A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/)**
9. **[A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A09_2021-Security_Logging_and_Monitoring_Failures/)**

## Labs Overview

This repository provides simple, vulnerable web application labs for each of the OWASP Top 10 security risks. The labs are intentionally designed to be easy to set up and explore, making them ideal for educational purposes. Each lab includes a scenario that demonstrates a specific vulnerability, allowing users to understand, exploit, and mitigate the risks in a controlled environment.

### Lab Structure

- **Lab 1:** [Broken Access Control](/A01-Broken-Access-Control/README.md)

## Getting Started

To get started with the labs, follow the instructions in each lab's README file. The labs are designed to run in a controlled environment, and it is strongly advised not to deploy or use them in a production setting.
